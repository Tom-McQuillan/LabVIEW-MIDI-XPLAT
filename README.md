# LabVIEW-MIDI-XPLAT
Cross-platform MIDI driver library built in Rust for LabVIEW integration. Provides a C-compatible API wrapper around the midir library, enabling LabVIEW applications to handle MIDI input/output across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms through compiled shared libraries (.dll/.so/.dylib).
